Portfolio Website
This is a README file for the Portfolio Website project.

Project Description
The Portfolio Website is designed to showcase my current projects, provide links to my social media profiles for easy communication, and include a personal blog section to give the audience a deeper insight into who I am.

Target Audience
The target audience for this website primarily consists of potential employers and friends who are interested in exploring my projects and getting in touch with me. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills, expertise, and interests.

Key Features
Project Showcase: The website provides an interactive display of my current projects, highlighting their key aspects and demonstrating my technical capabilities.
Social Media Integration: Direct links to my social media profiles are included, making it easy for visitors to connect with me through various platforms.
Personal Blog: The website features a dedicated blog section where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights, allowing the audience to gain a better understanding of my personality and interests.

Future Additions
Here are some projects that I plan to add to the Portfolio Website in the near future:

Calculator Project: I am working on developing a calculator application that will be added to the website. It will provide various mathematical functions and a user-friendly interface.

Etch A Sketch: I have an upcoming project inspired by the classic Etch A Sketch toy. It will allow users to draw and create artwork on the website, similar to the Etch A Sketch's functionality. Please note that this project will not include a save feature.

Snow Forecast Project: I am also working on integrating a snow forecast project specific to my local mountain. This feature will display real-time snow conditions, weather forecasts, and other related information.

I'm excited to bring these projects to the Portfolio Website and enhance its functionality and user experience.

Thank you for visiting my Portfolio Website!
