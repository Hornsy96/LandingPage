            <h2>Round 3 baby! May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p>Its been a crazy week, I went back down to Melbourne to see Annabel which was great. We met up with Pipes to get pizza at Leonardos taht was absolutely delicious
                I'd been doing snow chains at the start of the week and almost got my head run over by a big 4x4. Shop set up is still in progress with a long way to go.
                After this week i only have one left at the Genny and i am psyched for break before winter hits. Also I have applied for RMIT and hopefully get to go there next year.
                The image for this week is a pciture of Annabel in Melbourne when we went to Loch and Key</p>

            <h2>Week 2 of Blogging / May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p> It snowed! Ben and Mags left the mountain and its now just me until winter up here. I actually don't mind that much as I like the solitude,
                although i will miss them. Ive started properly splitting work between The Genny and Hoys which has been both a little bit stressful trying 
                to find time for myself as well. 
                The image for this week is a sunset from the back deck of The Genny this past summer.</p>

            <h2>My First Blog Post / May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p>This week has been great, I've been slowly getting back into web development over the last month and feel like I've really made my mind up that
                this is what i want to do with my life. Its been good having a goal again. The past weekend we went away for Annies birthday to Gaffneys Creek. 
                Its always such a good feeling to get back into nature and getting off the mountain is always a a bit of a recentre.
                Ive also started back helping the Hoys again, being in the rental shop really makes it feel like winter is right around the corner.
                The image for this week is one Koki took of me snowboarding at Mt Hotham.</p>
