            <h2>Round 3 baby! May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p>It's been a crazy week! I went back down to Melbourne to see Annabel, which was great. We met up with Pipes to get pizza at Leonardo's, and it was absolutely delicious. I had been doing snow chains at the start of the week and almost got my head run over by a big 4x4. The shop set up is still in progress, with a long way to go.

                After this week, I only have one week left at the Genny, and I am psyched for a break before winter hits. Additionally, I have applied for RMIT, and hopefully, I'll get to go there next year.

            <h2>Week 2 of Blogging / May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p> "It snowed! Ben and Mags left the mountain, and it's now just me until winter up here. I actually don't mind that much as I like the solitude, although I will miss them. I've started properly splitting work between The Genny and Hoys, which has been both a little bit stressful trying to find time for myself as well.

            <h2>My First Blog Post / May 15th 2023</h2>
            <p>"This week has been great. I've been slowly getting back into web development over the last month and feel like I've really made up my mind that this is what I want to do with my life. It's been good having a goal again.

                The past weekend, we went away for Annie's birthday to Gaffneys Creek. It's always such a good feeling to get back into nature, and getting off the mountain is always a bit of a reset.
                
                I've also started back helping the Hoys again. Being in the rental shop really makes it feel like winter is right around the corner.
